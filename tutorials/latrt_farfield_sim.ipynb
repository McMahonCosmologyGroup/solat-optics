One can set the near-field beam's location in the LATR focal plane, the source's position in the far-field (we set it to 100km away from the LAT aperture plane), and LAT mirror adjuster offsets (we set them to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We run the simulation from the terminal using $\\verb|mpiexec|$, which parallelizes the process.  To specify the number of processes, we use the \\verb|-n| option.  For example, to run with 10 processes, set $\\verb|mpiexec -n 4|$.  The simulation requires four input variables: 1) the frequency of the simulation (GHz), the resolution of the far-field map (arcmin), $\\pm$ scan size (arcmin), and near-field offset from LATR focus (m).  The simulation below should run in about 5 minutes.\n",
